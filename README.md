# PHP Class

This repository contains code from a few assignments and projects in my Server-Side Scripting with PHP class at UC Davis Extension.

## Projects
- sarahyoder-L7: Regular expressions and PHP form validation.
- sarahyoder-L8: Drawing captcha based on user input, using php image drawing functions
- sarahyoder-finalproject: Being the final project, this has by far the most code and most in-depth work. This is an employee portal that requires logging in to see some of the content. Concepts include logins, sessions, querying a relational database with PHP and MySQL, php image drawing, form validation, rss feeds, and more. Code is well-commented, so take a look!
